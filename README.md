# Global-Football-Coach
Multiplayer iOS American Football simulation game in the style of European soccer (promotion and relegation, youth academies instead of universities). Planning on publishing to the App Store by February 2023.

Started learning Swift in summer 2022 and have been working on this in my free time. Backend is NodeJS with a mySQL server. The majority of my code is located at GlobalFootball2/Views
